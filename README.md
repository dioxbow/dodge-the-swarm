# Repel the Swarm
This simple game requires you to avoid any and all contact with the red squares. You must accomplish this through a combination of shooting them and slipping through the gaps in their ranks. Luckily for you, the red squares are not that intelligent, and are slow to adapt to quick maneuvers.

Use either W-A-S-D or the arrow keys to move. Click to shoot at the red squares, and be sure not to touch them. Press P to pause and R to resume. Have fun!
